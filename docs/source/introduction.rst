Introduction
============

What is this project about?
---------------------------

The purpose of this project was to design, assemble, and demonstrate a 
cost-effective and visually-appealing replacement for the current Highway 
DEMO setups utilizing Intrepid Control Systems hardware and software.

Why do we need this?
--------------------

In turn, this will Reduces component cost per model and allow for more facilities 
and plants around the globe to implement this demo that may not have the same 
hardware/software we do.

.. note::
    The current cost per setup is around $7,200, but the total estimated cost per setup is estimated to be around $700.

How will this be achieved?
--------------------------

This will be done by eplacing costly components such as the 
Vehicle Spy3 software and neoVI FIRE 2 with more cost-effective and cost-friendly 
parts that would carry out the same functions, such as a Raspberry PI and neoECU.
