Welcome to the HOD Highway DEMO documentation!
==============================================

The Hands On Detection (HOD) Highway DEMO project was a project assigned to a Kettering University Co-Op student
to create a cheaper and equivalently efficient alternative to the existing DEMO located in 
the Highway of the Autoliv Auburn Hills Technical Center (ATC).

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

   Lumache has its documentation hosted on Read the Docs.
