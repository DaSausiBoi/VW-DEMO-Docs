Welcome to the The Hands On Detection (HOD) Highway DEMO project documentation! This was a project assigned to a

existing DEMO located in the Highway of the Autoliv Auburn Hills Technical Center (ATC).

Check out the :doc:`usage` section for further information, including
how to :ref:`installation` the project.

   This project is still WIP.
