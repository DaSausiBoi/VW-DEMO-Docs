Raspberry Pi
============

Use
---

To use the Raspberry Pi, you must first make sure that you connect the 
appropriate power supply, 5V @ 1A. This should be achieved by connecting the Raspberry
Pi to the Type-C connector wired to the buck down converter.

..note::
    Please make sure the input power to the Raspberry Pi is to specification. Both undervoltage and
    overvoltage will permanently damage the board.
